# First-Year-Projects
A collection of projects from my first year at MIT. All files are my lab submissions for the class "Fundamentals of Programming" (6.1010/6.009).

Short descriptions of projects in chronoloical order:

1. Audio Processing 
    - manipulating audio files to produce different effects.

2. Image Processing
    - manipulating greyscale images to produce different effects.

3. Image Processing pt 2
    - manipulating RGB images to produce different effects

4. Bacon Number
    - finding the Kevin Bacon number of different actors in a database
    - utilizes a flood fill searching technique to find connecting paths between actors

5. Snekoban
    - implementation of the game 'Sokoban'.

6. Recipes
    - tool that can keep track of different recipes that are comprised of different ingredients
    - utilizes recursion to design algorithms

7. Nd Mines
    - implementation of the game 'Mines' in N dimensions
    - utilizes recursion to design algorithms

8. SAT Solver
    - Satisfiability solver that can be used to solve logic puzzles
    - able to solve sudoku boards of any dimension
    - utilizes backtracking and boolean logic to solve


9. Autocomplete
    - creates working autocomplete and autocorrect functions
    - utilizes generators and classes
